## Managing Bot Instances

To prevent the "409: Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request" error, ensure that only one instance of the bot is running at a time. The bot now includes lifecycle management utilities that create a PID file to track running instances.

If you encounter this error, you have several options:

1. Use the clean start script that will automatically terminate any running instances:
   ```bash
   npm run clean-start
   ```

2. Manually kill any existing bot processes:
   ```bash
   pkill -f 'node.*copperXBot'
   ```

3. Restart your system or development environment if the issue persists.

The bot includes graceful shutdown handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals, which ensures that connections to the Telegram API are properly closed when the bot is stopped.
